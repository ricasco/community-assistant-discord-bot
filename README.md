# Community Assistant Discord Bot

## Introduction

Community Assistant Discord Bot is a sophisticated Discord bot designed to integrate with OpenAI APIs and hosted on Replit. This bot serves as an intelligent assistant within Discord communities, capable of handling a variety of tasks ranging from managing community interactions to fetching real-time cryptocurrency data. This project demonstrates my ability to architect and implement complex software solutions using modern Python libraries and APIs.

## Features

- **API Integration and Management**: Demonstrated through the integration of the OpenAI and CoinGecko APIs, showcasing skills in connecting and managing third-party services within a Python application. This capability is critical for any modern software development that requires external data or machine learning capabilities.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Extensively used async/await patterns provided by Python's asyncio library to handle operations asynchronously. This improves the bot's efficiency and response time, skills applicable in any high-load or real-time application.
- **Data Handling and Processing**: Implemented vector storage and retrieval with Qdrant and processed complex data structures, demonstrating the ability to manage and utilize large datasets effectively, which is essential for roles involving data engineering or machine learning.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilized OpenAI's GPT-4 model to process and respond to user queries in natural language, showcasing an understanding of NLP concepts which can be transferred to other domains such as chatbots, customer service automation, and content generation.
- **Security and Best Practices**: Maintained high standards of security by managing sensitive data like API keys and bot tokens through environment variables, illustrating knowledge of best practices in securing applications.
- **Custom Command Creation**: Developed a system to interpret and respond to specific commands within Discord, demonstrating capabilities in building interpretable user interfaces and command-line tools which can be adapted to various software and automation tools.
- **Dynamic Role Management**: Engineered role-based access control within Discord, showcasing the ability to implement complex permission systems which are crucial for enterprise software and team management applications.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Implemented robust error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure high reliability and maintainability of the application, skills that are critical for building fault-tolerant systems.

## Technologies

- **Python:** Main programming language used for developing the bot.
- **Discord.py:** A Python library to interact with Discord API for bot creation.
- **OpenAI API:** Leveraged for integrating artificial intelligence, particularly the GPT-4 model.
- **Qdrant and Langchain:** Utilized for creating a vector store and embedding retrieval, which supports the bot's QA system.
- **Replit:** Hosting platform that provides an online IDE and server capabilities.
- **CoinGecko API:** External API used for fetching real-time cryptocurrency data.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/botbuddy-discord-bot.git
   cd botbuddy-discord-bot
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and update it with your Discord bot token and other necessary API keys.
4. **Run the Bot:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

After running the bot, it can be interacted with on any Discord server where it has been added. Use specific commands like `!price BTC` to fetch the latest price of Bitcoin or `!roadmap` to view the project's development roadmap.
